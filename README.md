# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## INTRODUCTION
This porfolio includes python codes and final deliverables that I created while completeing CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course bewtween 2022 and 2023. 
I performed initial data and exploratory analysis of open-source data sets from Instacart, an online grocery store, to answer key business questions. My final deliverable was a report that included a population flow, analysis methodology, and recommendations to Instacart stakeholders. 

## UPLOADS
Uploads include several Jupyter notebooks of python codes that I used to conduct data and exploratory analysis and create visuals, including scatterplots, histograms, and bar charts...

## DATA
The data set used for this project is combines real Instacart data from 2017 and data created by CareerFoundry for the purposes of this project. Various datasets were cleaned and merged to create a final dataset that consists of 30m+ rows. The final data set includes details on customers, transactions, and products.
